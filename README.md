A VGA monitor requires 5 signals to display a picture:

    R, G and B (red, green and blue signals).
    HSync and VSync (horizontal and vertical synchronization).
    25.175 MHz Clock Freq is required.
    
The R, G and B are analog signals, while HS and VS are digital signals.
In the following diagram is all you need to know about VGA Timming. If you understand this, you will become a VGA master :)
